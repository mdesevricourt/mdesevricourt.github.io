This project explores how electoral accountability mechanisms interact with politicians’ incentives to choose policies that differ in their expected value and riskiness. It examines how first-term incumbents balance re-election concerns against welfare-maximizing choices, and how voters’ ability to discipline incumbents shapes equilibrium policy outcomes.
