Welcome to my academic website!  

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Georgetown University. My research focuses on political economy, economic theory, and AI governance. Here you can find information about my **research projects**, **publications**, **teaching materials**, and **blog posts** where I share notes and reflections on economics, governance, and related topics.  

This site is built using the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub Pages. I maintain it as a living repository of my work, teaching, and ideas.
